Just a simple DVD logo in Rainmeter, the only important logic is the X and Y measures, which start random at first but then just do `x=x+5` in a loop.

Only designed to work on the Primary screen. Can be circumvented by removing the `P` at the start of the variables and adding `@N` at the end of the variables like the docs says to make it monitor specific.

Project is abandoned.
